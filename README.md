# RSK Truffle Plant Box

Truffle box is configured to create a complete dApp using Truffle framework on [RSK Blockchain](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/), including a user interface to interact with the smart contract.

[RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) is an open source platform for Ethereum compatible smart contracts based on the Bitcoin network.

It was inspired by [Truffle pet shop box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/pet-shop). 
Thanks, Truffle team :)

## Requirements

There are a few technical requirements before we start. 
To use `Truffle boxes`, you need to have installed in your computer:

- Git
- a POSIX compliant shell
- cURL
- Node.js and NPM
- a code editor

If you don't have any of them installed, go to the tutorial [Truffle boxes prerequisites](https://developers.rsk.co/tutorials/truffle-boxes/truffle-boxes-prerequisites/) which have all the instructions to setup these requirements.

**Truffle framework**

Once you have those requirements installed, you only need one command to install `Truffle`.
It is better to do it globally:

```shell
npm install -g truffle
```

## Installing the Truffle box

1. Create a new folder. 
For example, create the folder `rsk-plant`.
Navigate to the folder in the terminal.

```shell
mkdir rsk-plant
cd rsk-plant
```

2. Run the unbox command. 
This also takes care of installing the necessary dependencies and it can take some time.

```shell
truffle unbox rsksmart/rsk-plant-box
```

This is the result using Windows OS:

## PlantShop.sol

Take a look at the smart contract `PlantShop.sol`. You can check it out in folder `contracts`.

![PlantShop.sol](/images/image-02.png)

This smart contract has:

* A variable `buyers` to store an array with 16 posisions to store addresses
* A function `getBuyers` to return the list of addresses stored at variable `buyers`
* A function `buy` to update an address at variable `buyers`, in the number of position sent as parameter

## Development console

Truffle has an interactive console that also spawns a development blockchain. This is very useful for compiling, deploying and testing locally.

3. Run the development console. This command is successful if you see a list of 10 accounts, a mnemonic and the command prompt is now `truffle(develop)>`

```shell
truffle develop
```

You will now be in the truffle develop console with seeded accounts and their associated private keys listed.

```txt
C:\RSK\rsk-plant>truffle develop

⚠️  Important ⚠️  : This mnemonic was created for you by Truffle. It is not secure.
Ensure you do not use it on production blockchains, or else you risk losing funds.

truffle(develop)>
```

> Inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.

4. Compile the smart contract. 

> To make sure you're in the development console, the command prompt must be `truffle(develop)>`

```shell
compile
```

The `compile output` should be similar to:

![truffle compile](/images/image-03.png)

5. Deploy (migrate) the smart contract. 

```shell
migrate
```

And the `migrate output` should be similar to:

![truffle migrate](/images/image-04.png)

6. Testing the smart contract.

This Truffle box also comes with the file `TestPlantShop.js` which include some examples for testing the smart contract. 
You can check it out in the `test` folder.

Run this command in the development console:

```shell
test
```

The `test output` should be similar to:

![truffle test](/images/image-05.png)

### Exit Truffle console

In the Truffle console, enter this command to exit the terminal:

```shell
.exit
```

## Using RSK networks

This Truffle box is already configured to connect to three RSK networks: 

1. regtest (local node)
2. testnet
3. mainnet

Testnet will be used here. For other networks:

**RSK regtest (Local node)**

To use the Truffle box connected to a local node, go to the tutorial [how to use Truffle connected to a local node](https://developers.rsk.co/tutorials/ethereum-devs/truffle-regtest/)

**RSK mainnet**

Follow the same instructions, just replacing `testnet` to `mainnet`.

### RSK testnet

We need to do some tasks:

- Setup an account and get R-BTC
- Update RSK network gas price
- Connect to an RSK network
- Deploy in the network of your choose


### Setup an account & get R-BTC

1. Create a wallet

The easy way to setup an account is using a web3 wallet injected in the browser.
Some options are:
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet)

Select the RSK Network in the web wallet.
- Nifty: select in the dropdown list
- Metamask: go to [RSK Testnet](https://developers.rsk.co/wallet/use/metamask/) to configure it in `Custom RPC`

![wallets](/images/image-06.png)

You can learn more about [account based RSK addresses](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/architecture/account-based/ "Account based RSK addresses - RSK Developers Portal").

Take a look `truffle-config.js` file to realize that we are using `HDWalletProvider` with RSK Networks derivations path:
- RSK Testnet dpath: `m/44’/37310’/0’/0`
- RSK Mainnet dpath: `m/44’/137’/0’/0`

For more information check [RSKIP57](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP57.md).

2. Update `.secret` file

After create your wallet, update your mnemonic in the file `.secret`, located in the folder project, and save it.

3. Get some R-BTCs:
- For the RSK Testnet, get tR-BTC from [our faucet](https://faucet.testnet.rsk.co/).

### Setup the gas price

**Gas** is the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send R-BTC, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated as gas. In RSK, this is paid in **R-BTC**.
The **minimumGasPrice** is written in the block header by miners and establishes the minimum gas price that a transaction should have in order to be included in that block.

To update the Testnet **minimumGasPrice** in our project run this query using cURL:

```shell
curl https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co/ -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false],"id":1}' > .minimum-gas-price-testnet.json
```

This query saved the details of latest block to file .minimum-gas-price-testnet.json 

In the `truffle-config.js`, we are reading the parameter `minimumGasPrice` from this json file.

For more information about the **Gas** and **minimumGasPrice** please go to the [gas page](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/rbtc/gas/ "Gas - RSK Developers Portal").

### Connect to RSK Testnet

Run the development console for any RSK network.

```shell
truffle console --network testnet
```

### Test the connection to RSK network

Run this commands in the Truffle console:

**Block number**

Shows the last block number.

```javascript
(await web3.eth.getBlockNumber()).toString()
```
**Network ID**

To get the network ID, run this command:

```javascript
(await web3.eth.net.getId()).toString()
```

List of network IDs:
- mainnet: 30
- testnet: 31
- regtest (local node): 33

Check it out the last steps in this image:

![connect to rsk network](/images/image-07.png)

You can verify that I get the last block twice, and the block number inscreased, so we conclude that the connection is ok.

Exit the Truffle console:

```shell
.exit
```

### Migrate the smart contract 

We will do it running the below commands directly in the terminal, without using the Truffle console, to show you this alternative.

On any of the networks, run this commands in a terminal (not in Truffle console).
To use Testnet or Mainnet, you need to specify this using the parameter `-- network`:

```shell
truffle migrate --network testnet
```

The migrate process in a real blockchain takes more time, because Truffle creates some transactions which need to be mined on the blockchain.

## The dApp

Included with the plant-shop Truffle Box was the code for the app's front-end. That code exists within the `src` directory.

> Make sure you have selected the RSK testnet in the wallet.

### Running the dev server

Now we're ready to use our dapp!

Start the local web server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The dev server will launch and automatically open a new browser tab containing your dapp.

It is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

![rsk plant garden](/images/image-11.png)

### Buying plants

In our garden store, don't worry about the prices, the plants are free!

Click the `Get` button on the plant of your choice.

You'll be automatically prompted to approve the transaction by the web wallet. 
Click submit / confirm to approve the transaction.

After the transaction is confirmed, you'll see the button next to the choosed plant change to show the first characters of the wallet that got the plant and become disabled, just as we specified, because the plant has now been acquired.

Congratulations👏👏👏! You built and ran a complete dApp on RSK network!
